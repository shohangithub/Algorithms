Auxiliary space refers to the temporary space or extra space that an algorithm uses to complete its work. This space can include temporary arrays and pointers. 
Space complexity is the total amount of space an algorithm uses in relation to the size of its input. Space complexity includes both the auxiliary space and the space used by the input. The formula for space complexity is: Space complexity = Auxiliary space + Input space. 
Understanding space complexity can help prevent memory issues and ensure that algorithms are efficient, especially when dealing with large data or limited resources. 


The notation O(1) signifies constant space complexity. It means that the amount of extra memory or auxiliary space used by the algorithm remains constant regardless of the size of the input.
